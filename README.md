# README

This is a simple chat application that sets up a messaging system where multiple users can send and receive messages in real-time.


## Dependencies

* `pipenv` for dependency management,
* `pytest` as a testing framework,
* `tika` as the RabbitMQ client library for Python,
* `tkinter` for creating the chat interface, `tkinter` is included with Python

The bin folder has scripts for basic commands.


### Notes on RabbitMQ

* Each client has a server to listen to messages, and each has its own connection. Tthis is because RabbitMQ is not thread-safe, and the listening needs to be in its own thread.

* Each client spawns it's own queue. This is to avoid messages being load-balanced between consumers of the same queue using round-robin.

* The exchange needs to be a fanout, the queues have autogenerated names and are exclusive.


## Setup

First, download the community Docker image for RabbitMQ, then type this to start it:

```sh
docker run -it --rm --hostname localhost --name rabbitmq -p 5672:5672 -p 15672:15672 rabbitmq:latest
```


## Install

Create an environment in your preferred way and then:

```sh
pipenv install
```


## To run

Run as many instances as users in the chat. This will connect to localhost:

```sh
. bin/run -u username
```

but you don't have to:

```sh
. bin/run -u username -o myhost
```

You can now type a message in the GUI and send it. All the GUIs will display the message in real time.


## To check status

```sh
. bin/status
```


## To test

```sh
. bin/test                    # all tests
. bin/test tests/test_file.py # single test
```


## To lint

```sh
. bin/lint
```
